# PRIME: Evaluating Implicit Biases in LLM Reasoning through Logic Grid Puzzles

This repository hosts the source code and website for **PRIME**, an evaluation framework designed to evaluate how **social biases** influence **logical reasoning** in Large Language Models (LLMs).

PRIME introduces:
- A **logic puzzle based framework** for probing implicit bias  
- Automatic puzzle generation of **generic**, **stereotypical**, and **anti-stereotypical** variants  
- A dataset of **6,048 logic puzzles** for evaluating gender bias in deductive reasoning  
- Fine-grained metrics including **edit-distance** and a **bias difference** measure 
- A logic solver backed pipeline to ensure a puzzle with **minimal, solvable clue sets**

The PRIME project webpage is here:

The dataset and code are available here:
